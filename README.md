# SQL-Challenge
For this week's module challenge we were given six CSV files that were imported into our SQL. It is absolutely important to import the data into their appropriate tables in order to avoid errors when performing the code. Each CSV file can be found within the EmployeeSQL folder under the folder titled "data."

###  **Data Modeling**
Create the tables in the following order: departments, titles, employees, dept_emp, dept_manager, salaries. Once the tables are created make sure to import the data into their corresponding table in the same order they were created. Departments, titles, employees have our primary keys and the remaining three tables have foreign keys which reference our main tables. The code for table creation can be found in the Schemata file. 

### **Data Engineering**
The goal of this module was to use the above CSV files to create tables to use the files in order to organize different tables based on what was asked. Using the Query file, we can organize a company's information by departments, employee number,first name, last name, salaries, and sex. 

### **Data Analysis**

For this assignment, I collaborated with Nicolas Ortega and Brendan Golden in creating the code.
