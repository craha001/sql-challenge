# SQL-Challenge
For this week's module challenge we were given six CSV files that were imported into our SQL. It is absolutely important to import the data into their appropriate tables in order to avoid errors when performing the code.
Create the tables in the following order: departments, titles, employees, dept_emp, dept_manager, salaries. Departments, titels, employees have our primary keys which is why they are created first.
